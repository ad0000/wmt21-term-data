<seg id="999"> such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease <term id="17" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="transmission" tgt="传播|传|传染"> transmission </term> modelling . </seg>

<seg id="1917"> as of March 12 , more than 370 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the <term id="20" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="spread" tgt="扩散|传播|扩散 蔓延"> spread </term> of COVID-19 . </seg>
<seg id="1918"> as of 29 March , nearly 90 % of the world 's learners were impacted by closures.Even when school closures are temporary , it carries high social and economic costs . </seg>
<seg id="1919"> the disruptions they cause affect people across communities , but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning , compromised nutrition , childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work . </seg>
<seg id="1920"> working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children , incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity . </seg>
<seg id="1921"> localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open . </seg>
<seg id="1922"> women often represent a large share of health-care workers and often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures . </seg>
<seg id="1923"> this means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a <term id="481" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="health crisis" tgt="健康 危机"> health crisis </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1924"> lack of access to technology or fast , reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families . </seg>
<seg id="1925"> lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning , especially for students from disadvantaged families . </seg>
<seg id="1926"> in response to school closures caused by COVID-19 , UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.To aid in slowing the <term id="17" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="transmission" tgt="传播|传|传染"> transmission </term> of COVID-19 , hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed . </seg>
<seg id="1927"> in the United States , numerous major cities announced public library closures , including Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , and New York City , affecting 221 libraries . </seg>
<seg id="1928"> for students without internet at home , this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning . </seg>
<seg id="1929"> school closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school . </seg>
<seg id="1930"> in the absence of alternative options , working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours , including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse . </seg>
<seg id="1931"> many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools . </seg>
<seg id="1932"> when schools close , nutrition is compromised.Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children.In Washington State , around 45 % of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals . </seg>
<seg id="1933"> at least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures.School lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the United States after food stamps . </seg>
<seg id="1934"> every year , nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast , lunch , snacks , and even dinner.In Alabama , where state-wide school closures as of 18 March have affected over 720,000 students , the state Superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches . </seg>
<seg id="1935"> school closures negatively impact student learning outcomes . </seg>
<seg id="1936"> schooling provides essential learning and when schools close , children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development . </seg>
<seg id="1937"> the disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school.Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends . </seg>
<seg id="1938"> this is especially true of protracted closures.Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction . </seg>
<seg id="1939"> when schools are closed , many children and youth miss out of on social contact that is essential to learning and development.When schools close parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task . </seg>
<seg id="1940"> this is especially true for parents with limited education and resources . </seg>
<seg id="1941"> potential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in federal acts of legislation at this time . </seg>
<seg id="1942"> formal education — as opposed to informal education or non-formal education — tends to refer to schools , colleges , universities and training institutions . </seg>
<seg id="1943"> a 1974 report by the World Bank defined formal education as the following : formal education : the hierarchically structured , chronologically graded ‘ education system ’ , running from primary school through the university and including , in addition to general academic studies , a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.The majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by COVID-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems . </seg>
<seg id="1944"> the UNESCO Institute for Statistics provides figures on students impacted by COVID-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary , primary , lower-secondary , and upper-secondary levels of education [ ISCED levels 0 to 3 ] , as well as at tertiary education levels [ ISCED levels 5 to 8 ] . </seg>
<seg id="1945"> early childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools , nursery schools , kindergartens , and some day care programmes . </seg>
<seg id="1946"> while many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to COVID-19 , measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied . </seg>
<seg id="1947"> in some countries and territories , preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.In the United States , the Washington State Department of Children , Youth , and Families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open . </seg>
<seg id="1948"> some school districts may offer alternative child care options , prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers . </seg>
<seg id="1949"> the governor of Maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while Washington State and California have left it to the discretion of care providers . </seg>
<seg id="1950"> California Governor Gavin Newsom explained his state 's position , saying “ We need our child care facilities , our daycare centers , to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures . ” </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Colorado has encouraged the development of " tool kits " for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.In Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed all schools throughout the country until April 8 , however , children 's daycare facilities were excluded . </seg>
<seg id="1952"> in early March , five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in Kobe tested positive for <term id="7" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="Coronavirus" tgt="新型 冠状病毒 ( COVID - 19 ) [ when referring COVID - 19 ] : 冠状病毒 [ when referring the generic virus group ]|冠状病毒|coronavirus|新型 冠状病毒|新冠 病毒"> Coronavirus </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1953"> after testing over one hundred children at the facility , a preschool student was found to be carrying the <term id="310" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="virus" tgt="病毒|virus|新型 冠状病毒|新冠 病毒"> virus </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1954"> primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education . </seg>
<seg id="1955"> the International Baccalaureate Organization ( IBO ) canceled the examinations for its Diploma Programme and career-related Programme candidates scheduled between 30 April and 22 May 2020 , reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="1956"> the IBO stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on " their coursework " and " the established assessment expertise , rigor , and quality control already built into the programme . " </seg>
<seg id="1957"> tertiary education , also known as higher education , refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school . </seg>
<seg id="1958"> tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education , as well as vocational education and training . </seg>
<seg id="1959"> individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates , diplomas , or academic degrees . </seg>
<seg id="1960"> undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education , for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor 's degree . </seg>
<seg id="1961"> students enrolled in higher education programmes at colleges , universities , and community colleges are often refereed to in countries such as United States as " college students . " the closure of colleges and universities has widespread implications for students , faculty , administrators , and the institutions themselves . </seg>
<seg id="1962"> colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board . </seg>
<seg id="1963"> in the United States of America , Colleges and universities operate as " mini-cities " which generate significant revenue for cities , states , and regions . </seg>
<seg id="1964"> for example , Princeton University contributed $ 1.58 billion USD to the New Jersey economy and students spent about $ 60 million in off-campus spending . </seg>
<seg id="1965"> College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.According to Linda Bilmes of the Harvard Kennedy School , " local hotels , restaurants , cafes , shops , car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions ... </seg>
<seg id="1966"> these communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time . " small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus . </seg>
<seg id="1967"> in Ithaca , New York , Cornell University students spent at least $ 4 million a week in Tompkins county . </seg>
<seg id="1968"> in the wake of Cornell 's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction , the Mayor of Ithaca called for " immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing . " </seg>
<seg id="1969"> UNESCO is sharing 10 recommendations during this period : </seg>
<seg id="1970"> examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools : decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies , internet connectivity , and digital skills of teachers and students . </seg>
<seg id="1971"> this could range through integrated digital learning platforms , video lessons , MOOCs , to broadcasting through radios and TVs . </seg>
<seg id="1972"> ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes : implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes , if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices . </seg>
<seg id="1973"> consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity . </seg>
<seg id="1974"> protect data privacy and data security : assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces , as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals . </seg>
<seg id="1975"> ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students ’ data privacy . </seg>
<seg id="1976"> prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching : mobilize available tools to connect schools , parents , teachers , and students with each other . </seg>
<seg id="1977"> create communities to ensure regular human interactions , enable social caring measures , and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated . </seg>
<seg id="1978"> plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes : organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students ’ knowledge of prior lessons . </seg>
<seg id="1979"> plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones , level of studies , needs of students needs , and availability of parents . </seg>
<seg id="1980"> choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based <term id="14" type="src_lemma_and_tgt_original" src="quarantine" tgt="隔离|检疫"> quarantines </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1981"> avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication . </seg>
<seg id="1982"> provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools : organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well , if monitoring and facilitation are needed . </seg>
<seg id="1983"> help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons . </seg>
<seg id="1984"> blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms : blend tools or media that are available for most students , both for synchronous communication and lessons , and for asynchronous learning . </seg>
<seg id="1985"> avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms . </seg>
<seg id="1986"> develop distance learning rules and monitor students ’ learning process : define the rules with parents and students on distance learning . </seg>
<seg id="1987"> design formative questions , tests , or exercises to monitor closely students ’ learning process . </seg>
<seg id="1988"> try to use tools to support submission of students ’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students ’ feedback </seg>
<seg id="1989"> define the duration of distance learning units based on students ’ self-regulation skills : keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students ’ self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes . </seg>
<seg id="1990"> preferably , the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes , and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students . </seg>
<seg id="1991"> create communities and enhance connection : create communities of teachers , parents , and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness , facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties . </seg>
