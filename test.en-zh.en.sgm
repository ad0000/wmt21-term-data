<seg id="340"> antibodies are an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) produced by B lymphocytes to fight <term id="524" type="src_lemma_and_tgt_original" src="pathogen" tgt="病原体"> pathogens </term> and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the <term id="524" type="src_lemma_and_tgt_original" src="pathogen" tgt="病原体"> pathogens </term> and neutralize them directly . </seg>

<seg id="345"> for example , antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome , which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity . </seg>
<seg id="346"> the concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low , and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients . </seg>
<seg id="347"> it is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global <term id="203" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="epidemic" tgt="流行性|疫情|流行|流行病"> epidemic </term> . </seg>

<seg id="350"> TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years . </seg>

<seg id="356"> however , this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation . </seg>
<seg id="357"> on February 18 , 2020 , Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine ( WM ) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM . </seg>

<seg id="705"> based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs , SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts , particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein . </seg>

<seg id="1124"> ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit , on Monday . </seg>
<seg id="1125"> these limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts , and on the chains ' Facebook pages . </seg>
<seg id="1126"> buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate . </seg>
<seg id="1127"> on Wednesday , Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order . </seg>
<seg id="1128"> these changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively . </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Coles , in its March 8 media release , reported that with the four-pack restriction in place , " many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery " , and called the demand " unprecedented " , while ALDI , in a Facebook post on Tuesday , called it " unexpected " . </seg>
<seg id="1130"> sales went up in a " sharp increase " last week , according to a Woolworths spokesperson . </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Costco 's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week . </seg>

<seg id="1134"> he expects rising production costs , as suppliers try to meet demand , and fewer specials . </seg>

<seg id="1137"> he remarked toilet paper is a bulky item , leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers , and , when sold out , leaves vast shelf spaces empty , hardening the feeling of a shortage . </seg>
<seg id="1138"> Coles and Woolworths have a view [ that ] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf , if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [ bought ] and are there in quantities , you would probably minimise the panic said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News . </seg>

<seg id="1140"> Kimberly-Clark , which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue , and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent , emphasized they were working 24 / 7 to maintain the supply , according to the News.com.au report . </seg>

<seg id="1142"> the Thursday edition of NT News , a daily printed in Darwin , included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper . </seg>

<seg id="2147"> this coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences . </seg>

<seg id="2417"> the extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase , and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine . </seg>
<seg id="2418"> ACE2 is present in most organs : ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells , enterocytes of the small intestine , arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs . </seg>
<seg id="2419"> ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex , striatum , hypothalamus , and brainstem . </seg>
<seg id="2420"> the primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE . </seg>
<seg id="2421"> ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II . </seg>
<seg id="2422"> ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II ( Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe ) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin ( 1-7 ) , ( H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH ) . </seg>
<seg id="2423"> ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [ des-Arg9 ] -bradykinin , apelin , neurotensin , dynorphin A , and ghrelin . </seg>

<seg id="2456"> Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance . </seg>
<seg id="2457"> the organisations declared eight conditions on governmental projects : </seg>
<seg id="2458"> surveillance would have to be " lawful , necessary and proportionate " ; </seg>
<seg id="2459"> extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses ; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> the use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes ; </seg>

<seg id="2465"> meaningful participation by all " relevant stakeholders " would be required , including that of public health experts and marginalised groups.The German Chaos Computer Club ( CCC ) and Reporters Without Borders ( Reporter ohne Grenzen ) ( RSF ) also issued checklists . </seg>
<seg id="2466"> the proposed Google / Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed . </seg>

<seg id="2471"> in South Korea , a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing . </seg>
<seg id="2472"> instead of using a dedicated app , the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data , and combined these to generate notices via text messages to potentially-infected individuals . </seg>
<seg id="2473"> in addition to using this information to alert potential contacts , the government has also made the location information publicly available , something permitted because of far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country . </seg>
<seg id="2474"> this information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.Countries including Germany considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems . </seg>
